<h1> Reading Response: What is Interaction? Are there different types? <h1> 

	While I was reading, 'What is interaction? Are there different types?' by Dubberly, Pangara and Haque they discussed design and interaction down the the T. What I personally received from this reading is how interaction is a key player in design, how it effects the users mindset and how it is a a reaction to the interface. There is a gap being filled between feeling and doing, that is where computer input/output plays a role. Previously thinking that interaction is one reaction of the design, computer interfaces is, "... not interaction, it vis reaction" stated Haque. This got me thinking, proving how much computers have an effect on our life, how easy it is now a days complete tasks and create things thanks to the simple reactions towards the input/outputs of computers. Than when the reading discussed the different system combinations I was a little confused but also impressed at the same time. Due to the complexity how user-interaction and how reacting to an input is so versatile it proves how important and influential web design is for modern day human functioning.
