	<h1> Reading Response: Keynote Sina Bahram Talk </h1> 

<p> 
It is always interesting to watch something that you would not stumble upon usually. My current Youtube recommendations are songs or a video on how to make a poached egg. As I watched the ILEAD USA Keynote talk by Sina Bahram, puts things into perspective, period. Setting that aside, I learned viewing every day objects  into if it can be accessible to truly everyone. As Bahram was discussing his mindset like that from the start is something very admirable and respectable, having a huge obstacle in your life and saying from a young age that you will not let this define you and you will enjoy your life regardless. As Bahram progresses he talks about the electronic tooth brush, something that I own and that my dad is very passionate about. Not thinking that this object is something that turns a normal toothbrush into a daily task easier for a wider range of people, it does. Simply changing the form and making it accessible for everyone. As he touches on 3D printing, the accessibility that this has for everyone around the world is remarkable. A piece brakes from your bed spring, go and print out a design online. Accessibility and simplicity. At the end Bahram discusses that when you build a website, you should start by expecting the user to do everything compared to building a simple website and then adding onto it. Thinking of it similar to architecture helped me explain the importance of function and expectations for a user. Overall this talk made me release how significant accessibility is for any and everyone and to expect the user to do everything you and think of and more.
