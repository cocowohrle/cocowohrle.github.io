<h1>Reading Response 1</h1> 

This weeks reading discussed the begging on Apple and how much trial and error coding is. Starting with Bill Atkinson making a lasting impact in Apple he was the leading design of grapics and user interface fo LISA, writting the QuickDraw graphics and designing the interface. Even the small things have a big impact on users, such as the arrow placement discussed in this reading. Bill said that if the arrow was placed at the top of a page user would expect to see more upwards, compared to the arrow being at the bottom of the page the user would expect to see more scorlling down. Reading through all the tests and trial/error times that Bill and Jef Raskin had while designing the software was very intresting however what I was excited to learn about was the 1984 Super Bowl comercial that advertised the launch of Apple Mac made by Ridley Scott. Watching that video I was so impressed with how advanced Apple was from the start and how much they have effected not only the world of technology but the world itself. Reading into the work of Bill Verplank, "how do you..." is what coding solves, which is very cleaver in my oppinion.
