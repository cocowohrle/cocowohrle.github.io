	<h1> Reading Response: Model View Culture </h1> 

<p> 
	Responding to the article posted by Model View Culture, “How Reporting and Moderation on Social Media is Failing Marginalized Groups”by Donyae Coles is something that I have seen and experienced myself as a technology user in the twenty first century. I guess I would just like to focus on the last point she made, “Social media platforms must step away form the idea that they are inherently 'fair' and accept that their idea of “fairness” in interaction is skewed simply by virtue of being born of a culture steeped in White Supremacy and patriarchy.” Social media is a choice, period. You can make an account and partake in it or you can refrain from it. With that being said, created an account you know the risks and openness that comes along with posting your thoughts and self online. The creators of Facebook may be white and male however they have created a platform, something that is out of their control with the user generated content interacts, they are simply using their tools. However, that has been a problem with racism, and horrific news such as the Ohio Killer on Facebook live shooting that old man. At the end of the day, people will say things, people will do crazy things, and social media can elevate it. It is part of the world we live in today, maybe this is a wake up call that it is something bigger than us and we can not control it, we should take a step back into real life.
